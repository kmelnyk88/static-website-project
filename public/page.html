                  The main character of the puzzle-platform horror adventure
                  game Little Nightmares II is Mono. Mono first appears at the
                  beginning of the game, where he wakes up in a Wilderness next
                  to a TV in the world that is distorted with Transmission of TV
                  tower where Thin Man resides. It is assumed that Mono had
                  recently traveled through that TV.
                </p>

                <p class="section-content">
                  He starts his adventure by traveling through a trap-infested
                  forest before arriving at a creepy old house. Inside, he finds
                  a little girl, whose name is Six (the main character of Little
                  Nightmares I), playing with a music box who is being held
                  hostage in the basement.
                </p>
                <p class="section-content">
                  Together, the two little beans face the horrors of the Cabin,
                  the School, the Hospital, and the Pale City itself, often
                  saving each other along the way and trusting each other
                  enough, despite being relative strangers, to literall hold
                  each other's lives in their hands. Throughout the game, Mono
                  does everything he can to rescue Six. Mono is even forced to
                  save Six from herself as she's been transformed into a giant,
                  long-armed monstrosity obsessed with a giant music box. In the
                  end, the two make a heroic run for safety, with Six catching
                  Mono as the tower crumbles behind them. And then, Six lets
                  Mono fall...It's a heartwrenching moment. After all they've
                  been through, after all the times they came through for each
                  other, Six chooses to betray Mono.

                  Throughout the game, Mono repeatedly finds himself having to
                  attune the Transmission of a television and tap into a twisted
                  hallway he first dreamed about in the Wilderness. In each
                  instance, Mono comes closer and closer to reaching an
                  eye-marked door at the end of the hallway, only to always be
                  pulled back into reality by Six.
                </p>
                <p class="section-content">
                  After Six's betrayal, Mono, shocked and hurt over his only
                  friend leaving him for dead, sits on a chair and allows time
                  to go by as the Transmission corrupts him. He ages and becomes
                  noticeably taller until he takes on the form of the Thin Man,
                  being locked in the Transmission tower, and to be inevitably
                  freed.
                </p>

                <p class="section-content">
                  The most popular theory is that the Thin Man and Mono exist in
                  a time paradox, as it is revealed that Mono grows up to become
                  the Thin Man after Six leaves him for dead in the Transmission
                  tower, trapping Mono in its depths and causing him to fester
                  in resentment as he ages, turning into a monster.

                <p class="section-content">
                  Like most other characters in the series, Mono rarely speaks.
                  Instead, his personality is shown in his actions.
                </p>

                <p class="section-content">
                  Mono appears to be a noble, confident, well-meaning boy who is
                  willing to go out of his way to help others, as shown when he
                  persists on freeing Six from her apparent imprisonment in the
                  Hunter's Cabin. He stays by her side, offering his help again
                  when she asks for it despite her initial rejection of his
                  assistance.
                </p>
                <p class="section-content">
                  Although Mono shows compassion for some, he is not hesitant to
                  kill any foes who intends to harm him and Six. Should they
                  encounter them, Mono is willing to go to any lengths to end
                  them if given the chance. Mono is also notably cautious of his
                  surroundings, and resourceful enough to use various objects in
                  his surroundings to evaluate the integrity and safety of the
                  path forward.
                </p>

                <p class="section-content">
                  His official description indicates that the character is quite
                  purposeful and stubborn in achieving his goals. Mono's main
                  feature is that he likes to wear various objects on his head
                  that hide his face, which may indicate his shyness or
                  unwillingness to show his personality.
